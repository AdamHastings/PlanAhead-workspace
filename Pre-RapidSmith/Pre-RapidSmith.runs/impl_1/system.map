   "inverter" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc4vlx60, package ff668, speed -11
This design is using the default stepping level (major silicon revision) for
this device (1). Unless your design is targeted at devices of this stepping
level, it is recommended that you explicitly specify the stepping level of the
parts you will be using. This will allow the tools to take advantage of any
available performance and functional enhancements for this device. The latest
stepping level for this device is '2'. Additional information on "stepping
level" is available at support.xilinx.com.

Total CPU time to MAP completion:   14 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Mapping completed.
